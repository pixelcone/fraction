/**
 * This trait is a helper unit that offers a shorthand for
 * calling Feature classes (more about Feature classes in
 * the project's README.md).
 *
 * This trait is almost the same as the AsAction one,
 * with one small difference: it is intended for classes
 * WHICH CALL other classes, not for the ones WHICH ARE
 * CALLED.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * 1. Import this trait into any controller/command class
 * 2. Create a plain Feature class and implement handle()
 *      method in it; this should be the only public method
 *      in this class
 * 3. Call $this->run() method from controller/command,
 *      passing Feature class' FQN as a first argument and
 *      an array of key-value pairs, corresponding to the
 *      Feature class' constructor, as a second one
 * 4. VoilÃ ! You have just instantiated a Feature class
 *      and ran its handle() method using a single call!
 *
 * This trait grew from the concept of an intermediate
 * layer between controllers/commands and action classes.
 * The main idea behind this trait is to make Feature
 * classes be easily accessible from within
 * controllers/commands while keeping former and latter as
 * clean as possible.
