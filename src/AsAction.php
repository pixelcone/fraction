/**
 * This trait provides a shorthand for instantiating any
 * class and immediately calling some of its methods.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * 1. Import this trait into any class
 * 2. Implement handle() method in this class; this should
 *      be the only public method in it
 * 3. In place where you need to create an object of this
 *      class, call to its static run() method, passing the
 *      same arguments as defined in class' constructor
 * 4. VoilÃ ! You have just created an object and ran its
 *      handle() method using a single call!
 *
 * As this trait requires host class to have a public method
 * for calling, the best usage scenario for it is so-called
 * action classes: plain, standalone PHP classes that contain
 * the logic for one specific task (actually, this trait is
 * originally created as a supplement for such classes).
 *
 * More about action classes in the project's README.md.
